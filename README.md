### BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

> Forensic medicine is an interesting area of study. Forensic 
  dentistry is a branch of forensic medicine.

> During natural calamities or due to some other reasons, 
  many times, it will not be possible to find out the gender of 
  the deceased person.

> In such cases, certain measurements of the tooth will be 
  taken (as bones and teeth do not decay easily) and gender 
  will be determined.
